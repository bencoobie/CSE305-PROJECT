## 1)THE GOAL OF THE PROJECT
•The primary goal of the project is to encourage individuals to be more cautious in areas where previous accidents have occurred by allowing them to see the locations of past accidents.

•As part of this project, a map-based application has been developed. This application enables users to view areas with a high frequency of accidents on the map, 
providing information when planning their routes.

•Each accident location is recorded in a database, including detailed information such as date, time, causes, and outcomes. 
Additionally, a system that sends alerts to users to be cautious in these areas has been integrated.

•The project also offers educational and awareness materials on safe driving practices, causes of accidents, and prevention.
